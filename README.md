# Xarigami Formantibot Module

Format Anti-Bot module secures forms from abuse by bot's by requiring translation 
and input of a simple numeric challenge question or image based text, also known as CAPTCHA.
The module can be used in conjunction with other Xarigami modules that support it either 
via hooks or through direct use of apis in the module.

The following modules currently support FormAnti-Bot:

* DynamicData - a core distribution module responsible for creation of your own content via dynamic data hooks and objects.
* Sitecontact module - a contact form module allowing multiple, custom contact forms, and optional saving of data.
* Comments module - a comments module with moderation and spam control features.
* xarBB - a lightweight forum module that can be optioned up with various features via hooks.
